# # Intro

![cover](/projects/Inventory-System/cover.jpg)

This App is a web application built with Next.js, a React framework. designed to help you manage and keep track of inventory items efficiently.

I was thinking about creating an inventory system using modern web technology and I chose nextjs because I like popular technology, you might ask why not just use nuxt because previously I used vue? the answer is because it is more popular and more flexible, the key word here is popular, because more people use it then finding the answer to the error you are experiencing becomes easier
