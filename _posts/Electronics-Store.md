# # Intro

![cover](/projects/Electronics-Store/cover.jpg)

I created an e-commerce app using VueJS and CapacitorJS. In this app, users can easily browse through all available products or filter them by category of their choice. They can also make secure payments for the electronic products they wish to purchase.

This application implements the xendit payment gateway to make payments between the user and the shop concerned. here I use capacitorJS as a 'wrapper' so that it can run on android, I know people will definitely prefer react native if they want to create cross-platform applications, but i don't know or haven't found yet an equivalent like react native for vueJS, so yes I using capacitorJS which is simpler because it shares the same codebase as the web version and can access 'native features' from Android such as the camera, notifications, etc.

The weakness of this app is that the only language available is Indonesian, and the codebase needs to be refactored (i'll do that if i have a lot of spare time)

App Features :

1. browse all product vertically with infinite scroll, soo no boring pagination numbers.
2. search product.
3. browse product by category.
4. change user profile like username, avatar, password and add/change/remove user addresses
5. view payment history.
6. user can pay the product using e wallet or qrcode.
7. product details covers : product description, add/view/remove reviews. 
8. other users review and related product recommendation.
9. cart page covers : add/remove products user add, select address and select payment method.
10. add/remove favorite product.

and some more ...
