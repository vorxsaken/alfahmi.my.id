# # Intro
![cover](/projects/Food-Recipe/cover.jpg)

So I thought about making a website where users find the food recipes they want, and the data source is from calling an external api, but a really good api, sets a price to be able to access all its features, and that's impossible for me because I'm fucking broke ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚, That's why I changed the original plan and made the users themself provide the data source, the user can add his own recipes or view recipes from other users, and for the demo application, the data presented is artificial data from a javascript library called fakerjs.
